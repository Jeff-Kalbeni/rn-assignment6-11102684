## Welcome to my DressUp APP
### HomeScreen
The Home screen displays a list of items using a FlatList which allows a user to add an item from the list to cart. There is a "Go to Cart" button which takes a user to another screen where he can view the items he added to cart. Here are screenshots of the home screen.
